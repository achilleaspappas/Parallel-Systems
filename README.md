# Parallel Systems

The purpose of this project is to implement parallel algorithms using OpenMP and CUDA. The source code files address different exercise problems. This project was part of a course I did in my 9th semester.

## Prerequisites

To use the files in this repository, you will need the following:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) in order to run openMP files.
- [NVDIA Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) in order to run CUDA files.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code file using the appropriate compiler and compile flags. 

    For openMP:
    ```
    gcc file.c -o file -fopenmp
    ```
    For CUDA:
    ```
    nvcc file.cu -o file
    ```
3. Run the executable file generated by the compilation process.
    ```
    ./file
    ```

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:
1. Source_Code_1.c
2. Source_Code_2A.c
3. Source_Code_2B_1.c
4. Source_Code_2B_2.c
5. Source_Code_2B_3.c

## Specifications

### Functionality

### Source_Code_1.c

A matrix A(NxN) is called "strictly dominating diagonal" if for each row of 'i' it is true that:
```
|𝛢𝑖𝑖| > ∑ |𝐴𝑖𝑗| where j=0…N-1 i<>j
```
- Check (in parallel) whether the matrix A is strictly diagonally dominated.
- If this is the case, calculate in parallel (use OpenMP's reduction clause appropriately
at this point) the maximum (m) in absolute value element of the diagonal of 
```
Α (m = max(|𝛢𝑖𝑖|), i=0…N-1)
```
- Then based on this (m) make (in parallel) a new table B(ÿxN) (which it will print at the
end on the screen) where:
```
𝐵𝑖𝑗 = m – |𝐴𝑖𝑗| για i<>j και 𝐵𝑖𝑗 = m για i=j
```
- For the above table B , it is also requested to calculate in parallel (and print on the
screen) its minimum value element using the reduction clause.

### Source_Code_2A.c

Write a program in OpenMP that sorts a sequence of N integers A[0…N-1] in parallel,
according to the recursive sorting algorithm 'multisort'.

### Source_Code_2B_1.c

Write a program in CUDA to calculate the 2-D convolution. Specifically, given a 2-D register
A, to calculate its new value at position (i,j) both the current value of that specific position
and the values of all its neighboring elements (9 values in total) are used, each of which is
multiplied by a "weight". The calculation is shown in the figure below. For the new register A'
that will result from the calculations, it is also requested to find the minimum value (min) of
the elements of its diagonal.

```
A’(i, j) = c11 ∙ A(i - 1, j - 1) + c12 ∙ A(i, j - 1) + c13 ∙ A(i + 1, j - 1) +
c21 ∙ A(i - 1, j) + c22 ∙ A(i, j) + c23 ∙ A(i + 1, j) +
c31 ∙ A(i - 1, j + 1) + c32 ∙ A(i, j + 1) + c33 ∙ A(i + 1, j + 1)
```

### Source_Code_2B_2.c

Write a program in CUDA that, given a 2-D register A of dimensions NxM and a vector x of size M, is asked to compute the expression 
```
A^T * A * x 
```
that is the product of the inverse of the register times the original register times the vector x. For
limiting the number of transactions and the intermediate storage space that
required for the calculation, the A ∙ x calculation is performed first.

### Source_Code_2B_3.c

Write a CUDA program that, given a 2-D matrix A, calculates the covariance matrix of A as
follows:
- For each column of register A calculates the average of the elements of the column.
- From each element of a column of register A subtracts the average of the corresponding
column calculated in the previous step.
- Multiplies the A register of the previous step by the inverse of this register. Because the
resulting register is symmetric, it is sufficient to calculate either the upper or lower triangular
part of the result.
